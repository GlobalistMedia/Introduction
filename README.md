##  Branching Strategy & Environments

To improve our development workflow and code quality, we are adopting a branching strategy with two main branches:

- **dev**: All new features and updates are pushed here first. This branch is deployed to a staging/QA environment where the team and QA can test and verify changes before production.
- **main** (or **master**): This branch contains production-ready, stable code. Only thoroughly tested and approved changes from `dev` are merged here for production release.

**Branch Protections:**
- Both `main` and `dev` branches are protected to prevent accidental direct merges or force pushes. All changes should go through pull requests and code review.

**Workflow:**
1. Developers create feature branches from `dev`.
2. Once a feature is complete, open a PR into `dev` for review and testing.
3. The `dev` branch is automatically deployed to a staging/QA environment.
4. After successful QA, changes are merged from `dev` into `main` for production deployment.

**Syncing Branches:**
After any PR is merged from `dev` to `main`, we immediately sync `dev` with the latest changes from `main`. This ensures both branches remain up to date and prevents divergence.

This process ensures higher code quality and safer releases.
